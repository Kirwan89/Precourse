# Homework #JSIV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects
	Objects are the underlying structure of the javascript framework.  They allow for the creation of custom methods for the manipulation of properties, they store data and represent it in relation to keys instead of order.

	* Properties
	When defining an object, the attributes are titled and assigned values using this naming convention. Built in properties are characteristics of all object types.

	* Methods
	Operate predefined actions on data in arrays and strings or custom rules when created in Objects.

	* for in loop
	A for loop specifically for objects, allows for the operation of methods through properties in an object by using keys instead of sequential order. 

	* Dot notation vs bracket notation
	Methods are called on to act on properties using both dot and bracket notation.  Dot notation is the best practice when updating object keys, bracket notation allows properties to be reassigned without knowing the what the variable is set to. 

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test JSIV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
